        <h2>HELLO WELCOMING YOU TO SECTION1 <em>(using inline)</em></h2>
        <p>Inline CSS allows you to apply styles directly to an HTML element using the style attribute. This method is
            useful for quick tests or when you want to apply a unique style to just one element. For example, you can
            make a paragraph green by writing. However, inline CSS is not recommended for large projects because it clutters
        the HTML and makes styles hard to maintain or reuse.</p>

    <section id="sec2"> <!--USING INTERNAL-->
        <h2>HELLO WELCOMING YOU TO SECTION2 <em>(using internal)</em> </h2>
        <p> Internal CSS is written within a style tag inside the head section of an HTML file. This method is best
            suited for single-page documents where all styling is kept in the same file. It provides better organization
            than inline CSS and allows you to apply styles to multiple elements using selectors.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sec3"><!--USING EXTERNAL-->
        <h2>HELLO WELCOMING YOU TO SECTION3 <em>(using external)</em></h2>
        <p>
            External CSS involves writing styles in a separate .css file and linking it to your HTML using the link
            tag. This is the most scalable and preferred method for real-world websites, as it separates structure
            (HTML) from design (CSS). You only need to change the CSS file once to affect all linked pages.
