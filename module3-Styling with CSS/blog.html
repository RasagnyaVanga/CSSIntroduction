            <h1>Our Chandler Bing</h1>
            <p>Chandler Muriel Bing is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends,
                portrayed by Matthew Perry.[2] Chandler was born to Nora Tyler Bing, an erotic
                romance novelist, and Charles Bing, a gay female impersonator and star of a
                Las Vegas drag show called "Viva Las Gay-gas" as Helena Handbasket.
                It is revealed in the first season that he went to an all-boys high school.
            </p>
            <p>Chandler's best friends are his roommate Joey Tribbiani, and Ross Geller, his
                college roommate. He met Ross's sister, Monica Geller, and her friend Rachel Green
                while visiting Ross's parents' house. Chandler was the first person to know about
                Ross's love for Rachel.[citation needed] He moved to New York City and lives across
                the hall from Monica. He meets Phoebe Buffay through her. Chandler has a very good
                sense of humor and is notoriously sarcastic, which he credits as a defense
                mechanism developed during his parents' divorce when he was a child.
                He is the most financially secure member of the Friends due to responsible income
                management, having learned the value of money at a young age.[
                He suffers from commitment issues, but he later marries Monica at the end of the
                seventh season. In the tenth season, Chandler and Monica adopt twins, Jack and Erica.
